# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

I have started to look into web development on my own looking at different tools that can build a webpage. This study guide is the beginning steps to getting familar with building a webpage. The following study guide taught me briefly what HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The final product of learning these topics led to me building a simple webpage with some notes on each topic and the webpage itself demonstrates some of the skills from the different topics.
